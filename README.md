# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise needs assistance in performing a deep dive into a large block of crowdfunding data in regards 
to varying performances. In order to assist Louise with identifying what she needs based on her provided 
criteria, the data will need to be cleaned, consolidated, and visualized for Lousie to make the most accurate 
decision.

### Purpose

The purpose of the project was to perform data analysis on thousands of crowdfundng projects to 
visually depict and identify hidden trends.

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed using varying Excel formulas to iterate through the thousands of records 
in order to consolidate into specific categories. Once the formulas were finalized and the data was 
cleaned based on the desired outcome, pivot tables and line charts were created and filtered to then 
view each category visually. The charts/images were color-coded and labeled for simple view and are 
the result of all of the data analysis. A few challenges that were encountered were perfecting the 
unfamiliar formulas and ensuring the outputs were correct. There was some basic troubleshooting, but 
ultimately the data matched the provided examples. Additionaly, the data with the charts (columns/values/count)
took a few attempts in order to match the provided examples. Additionally practice with different datasets
should continue to build a better foundation of knowledge on these actions. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The overall successful and failed theater outcomes appear to follow a similar trend throughout the year
while the most appeared to be successful and there was the canceled were relatively
low in comparison. Additionally, the months of May and June both show a large spike in both the successfull
and failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When comparing the theater outcomes based on the goals, the trend lines for the successfull and failed 
worked in opposite directions. There was a higher percentage for both categories in the Less than 1000 and 
1000 to 4999 goals. Additionally, there were none that were canceled when based on the goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A large challenge was managing the time dedicated to the data analysis during the holidays. A few 
other challenges included encountering syntax errors when writing the formulas and adjust the categories in
order to visually depict the data correctly in charts. This took some trial and error until the correct format
and data was displayed correctly.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The two conclusions that 
can be drawn from the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that the successful/failed outcomes trend 
similarly with both peaking in the May/June months. The slowest is during December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The conclusion of the Outcomes based on Launch Date
are that there were more cheaper goals for the successful and failed outcomes. Additionally, unlike the Launch
Date Outcomes, the successfull and failed outcomes based on the goal trend opposite.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Number of Pledges
2. The different currencies might skew the data

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Additional charts based on other Outcomes (Ex. subcategories)
